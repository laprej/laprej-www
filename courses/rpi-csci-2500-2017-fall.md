### Grading and Other Class Policies

*  14%: Lab sections
*  30%: 6 homeworks, 5 pts each -- due every other Wednesday.
*  42%: 7 quizzes, 6 pts each, given in class every other week on Tuesdays or Fridays.
*  14%: 1 project.

**We will also be using Submitty (AKA the homework server).  Details
  will follow on Piazza.**

**Attendance Policy**: Attendance at lectures is not required, but
be aware that we may include material not necessarily covered in the
text or on the web page.  You are responsible for all announcements
made in lecture (e.g., any change in due dates).

**Lab Sections**: Lab attendance is mandatory and you will be graded.
Keeping up with the labs will be the best way for your to make sure
that you do not fall behind.

**Group Project**: The group project allows for groups of up to 3-4
students to collaborate on a larger assignment than the individual
assignments typically require.  15% of each student's grade will be
determined by their peers.  If two students code the entire project
while a third does nothing, that student should not expect the same
score as the rest of the team.

**Late Assignments Policy**: Three late days are permitted for
assignments.  They will be consumed in whole day increments. In other
words, if you are one hour late, that will count as one day. 25 hours
late will count as two days, etc. Once these are exhausted, late
assignments will not be graded.

**Grade Disputes**: Grade disputes must be made within 10 days.
After 10 days has elapsed, the grade on record will stand.

**Assignment Grading Criteria**: Programming assignments are graded as
follows: 15% for proper comments (e.g., each function should indicate
what it does) and 85% for a correct working implementation. We
typically divide the correctness points over key functions
working. For example, reading -- worth 10 points, writing -- worth 10
points as file correctly, and then doing the calculation correctly --
worth 65 points. Note that programs that either don't compile or
generate a `core dump` typically get no more than 20 points of the
85. Thus, your max score for a "properly commented" program that fails
in some fundamental way is only 35 points even if you spent 100 hours
of time on it.  Non-programming assignments/homeworks are graded on a
per-problems basis. Typically 5 problems will be given and each is
worth 20 points.  These should be typed up using a word processor of
your choice e.g., MS Word, LaTeX, etc.  These must be submitted on
Submitty as well.

### Students With Special Needs

Federal law requires all colleges and universities to provide
specified types of assistance to students with disabilities.  If you
require such assistance, please obtain an authorizing memo from
Disability Services for Students by contacting the Student Health
Center.  Information about a student's special needs will be treated
as confidential.  Please submit a copy of your authorizing memo to
your professor well in advance of any affected exam or
assignment. Failure to do so may result in a lack of special
accommodations.

### Academic Integrity

While I strongly encourage you to form study groups and work together
in learning this material, the course project, homeworks and
programming assignments are to be done individually unless otherwise
noted by the assignment/project specification. What this means is that
you should do whatever is necessary to ensure your work remains your
work. If during in the grading process, it is determined that students
shared or duplicated work, those students will automatically score a
zero for the offense.  For a second offense, the student or students
involved will fail this course and a report will be sent to the Dean
of Students office which could result in additional disciplinary
action.  Additionally, undergraduates offenders cannot mentor in the
future.  In the event a graduate student is caught cheating, that
student will fail.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Apply the concepts of the C programming language to the construction
of moderately complex software implementation problems.
* Apply the concepts of assembly language to correct and efficient
translation of a given C programming language into the course required
assembly language(s).
* Apply the concepts of integer and floating point formats to convert
from the base-10 integer or scientific format into the correct machine
readable binary format.
* Apply the concepts of Boolean Algebra to simplify given Boolean equations.
* Apply the concepts of K-Maps to the problem of Boolean expression
  simplification.
* Apply the concepts of Performance to the analysis of computer
  performance problems.
* Apply the concepts of a multi-cycle datapath and control by showing
in written form the processing steps that different classes of
instructions require as they move through the datapath and control
hardware structures.
* Apply the concepts of a pipelined datapath and control by showing in
written form the processing steps that different classes of
instructions require as they move through the datapath and control
hardware structures.
* Apply the concepts of caching and memory hierarchy to solve a
problem which requires you to design the "best" cache system given
particular design constraints.
* Apply the concepts of parallel programming to the
construction/implementation of a correct and efficiently executing
multi-threaded program.
