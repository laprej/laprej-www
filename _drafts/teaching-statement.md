I consider myself a life-long student.
In my years of study, I have discovered trends that can help lead to a successful academic career.
These are:
(i) fast turnaround times for feedback through testing,
(ii) recognizing familiar problems, and
(iii) engaging the students.

## Faster Iteration

All too often, novice programmers write 50, 100, or more lines of code only to discover that it does not compile.
While compiler error messages have been improving, message-parsing abilities by the student are often not mature enough to decipher the gibberish spewed from the compiler.
Any advice to "fix the first problem" invariably falls on deaf ears.
Encouraging students to adopt a *test driven development* (TDD) methodology can improve the way they develop their code in several ways.
First, the amount of code to examine is typically smaller as the scope is reduced to simply passing the next test.
Second, by focusing on one component at a time they are "nearer" to the source of the problem.
Third, it builds a sense of accomplishment as they eliminate bugs and see more and more tests passing.
Students needs to iterate faster when they have less experience.
As the student becomes more confident and knowledgeable, less feedback is required.

## Problem Recognition

Incoming freshmen have been trained in passing standardized exams.
Yet the wealth of knowledge available to your average smartphone owner is mind-boggling; it no longer makes sense to have students memorize facts.
A better tactic is building solid *pattern matching* skills.
Being able to recognize a spin on a graph coloring problem is far more useful than trying to attack the problem from scratch.
Additionally, it is likely that a fair amount of code exists online that already solves this problem, at least partially.
Seeing a variety of twists on known problems helps to improve problem recognition and increase insight into problems at a deeper level.
Exposure to a breadth of problems helps to foster critical thinking abilities and to more quickly discover solutions.

## Engaging Students

I like to keep the atmosphere of my class light.
To break up long lectures, in addition to getting a drink and stretching, I find that students enjoy short and non-class-related videos.
I find that these introduce some degree of levity as well as helping the students relax.
By creating a comfortable environment, the students feel less inhibited asking and answering questions.
Another one of my favorite tactics is a short *problem of the day* (POTD).
The POTD must be (physically) handed in during class but the student need not even attempt it; the student's name on the paper is all that is required.
The benefits of this are twofold: it encourages attendance and gives the student further opportunities for studying the material.
As an added bonus, the POTD gives me further insight into the students who are putting forth more effort than their colleagues; this data comes in handy when deciding if a borderline student deserves a "bump."

## Small Group Approach

While the previous comments are appropriate for a large lecture-style class, I have had the pleasure of teaching a smaller topic-oriented class.
My primary responsibility in this case is coaching the students towards reachable and achievable goals.
Student-led discussion lends itself to collaborative learning.
Small groups of upper-class students have much more experience to draw from and need less direct instruction.
In these situations I take an approach more in line with *guided facilitation* in which the student groups explore different possibilities while I am there to manage and support them.
Learning is often a two-way street: naturally the students are learning from me but I am simultaneously learning from them using this methodology.
