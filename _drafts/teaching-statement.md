<p class="text-justify">
I consider myself a life-long student.
In my years of study, I have discovered trends that can help lead to a successful academic career.
These are, in no particular order:
(i) fast turnaround times for feedback through testing,
(ii) out-of-the-box thinking, and
(iii) engaging the students.

## Faster Iteration

<p class="text-justify">
All too often, novice programmers write 50, 100, or more lines of code only to discover that it does not compile.
While compiler error messages have been improving, message-parsing abilities by the student are often not mature enough to decipher the gibberish spewed from the compiler.
Any advice to "fix the first problem" invariably falls on deaf ears.
Encouraging students to adopt a test driven development (TDD) methodology can improve the way they develop their code in several ways.
First, the amount of code to examine is typically smaller.
Second, by focusing on one component at a time they are "nearer" to the source of the problem.
Third, it builds a sense of accomplishment as they eliminate bugs and see more and more passing tests.
The student needs to iterate faster when less experience is available.
As the student becomes more confident, less feedback is required.
As the student develops more proficiency allow increasing durations between feedback.

## Thinking Creatively

<p class="text-justify">
The wealth of knowledge available to your average smartphone owner is mind-boggling; it no longer makes sense to have students memorize facts.
Let your subconscious do the heavy lifting -- that's what it's good at
Learn to silence your mind

## Engaging Students

Humor
Problem of the day
