The following paragraphs reflect some of my *current* guiding principles for research.
They should never be considered, "set in stone" but rather in a constant state of question, refinement, and hopefully improvement.

## Software engineering

This first item arguably has the least amount of actual research potential insofar as good practices rarely result in publishable work.
That does not diminish the importance of good software engineering practices including:
1) test-driven development
2) proper documentation including both developer and user perspectives, and
3) continuous integration

Some projects are short and others are long.
You never know how long a project will last.
By adopting good software engineering principles and utilizing them throughout the life of the project, it will make refactoring easier as well as introducing new, possibly research-worthy features into your code base.

Computer scientists work in and develop algorithms.
These algorithms are ultimately realized in code, written by humans, and therefore susceptible to errors.
We must strive to eliminate these errors through tried and tested methodologies.

## Compilers

Compilers are the gate-keepers for new software systems.
If you cannot articulate yourself in a clear manner to the compiler, then your compiler cannot generate high performance or easily parallelizable code.

## Cloud-based resources

## Future PDES systems

Future PDES systems must be modular.
They must also be easily extendible.
